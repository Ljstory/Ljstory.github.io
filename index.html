      <p>
        Our character Tyler has a very busy schedule and loves going to the gym when it's not busy. When in class, he says to himself that he'll go to the gym after class. Only problem is he's hoping it's not packed. He then remembers he can check the new UofSC gym app and see how busy it is. Because of this he realizes the gym is very busy and is happy that he didn't have to leave to check.
